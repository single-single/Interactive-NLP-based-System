This project was written in Python 3.6 on a Mac using PyCharm, so running with PyCharm is preferred. To run it with PyCharm, simply load the project folder "Chatbot" into it and use the "Run" button to run "main.py".

To run it from a Mac terminal, first open the path to the project folder "Chatbot" using "cd" command, then run it with the command "python main.py".

The demonstration video also shows the way to run it in the terminal.
